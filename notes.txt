Create requirements.txt using:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
If you have installed your package in a virtual environment to make testing easier,
be *sure* to delete your package from the requirements file.

To install this package in your virtual environment:
pip install . -e
Use -e to install as a symlink/in editable mode.
This allows source changes to be immediately available to 'others', that is,
your unit tests.

If you edit the package and it is not installed with a symlink, run
pip install . --upgrade

To uninstall this package from your virtual environment:
pip uninstall <package_name>

Place your own scripts in bin/
If you put scripts here and modify setup.py so it knows about them,
you will be able to run your scripts from the command line in your virtual environment.
It is recommended to use 'entry_points' in setup.py for cross-platform support instead of 'scripts'.
